This list is to provide a record of problems for tests to add coverage for if possible.

tries to use more memory + cpus (1.1, 288) than available (1, 256)
I0615 19:39:51.983000  9813 master.cpp:3336] Sending status update TASK_ERROR (UUID: 166e5ad8-947a-4acc-ad76-0820eca3bbc8) for task {"name":"etcd-1434421077","task":"","host":"localhost.localdomain","rpcPort":31000,"clientPort":31001,"type":"existing","slaveID":"20150615-152726-16777343-5050-9809-S6"} of framework 20150611-164414-16777343-5050-10806-0002 'Task uses more resources cpus(*):1.1; mem(*):288; disk(*):1024; ports(*):[31000-31001] than available cpus(*):1; mem(*):256; disk(*):1024; ports(*):[31000-31001]'

does not always clear running instances, leading to it rejecting offers when it needs to heal
  fixed?

does not retrieve persisted framework id when clusterName = t3
  fixed?

does not deconfigure node before trying to add a new one, livelocking the cluster
  cause: was trying to deconfigure a nonexistent node id
  fixed

when fw dies, then slave dies, then fw fails over, it will launch before removing the slave that died while the fw was down
  cause: fw did not verify that defunct nodes are purged before launching
  fixed

executors stay alive forever when master, slave, or etcd instance fails

fw does not re-register after master fails and then restarts?

when all tasks are killed, scheduler blocks indefinitely while trying to deconfigure them
  should: verify that all etcd instances are unavailable, initiate HARD RESET (to be called by register and reregister as well)

executors in staging state for a long time (don't send any updates) will just stay alive as zombies forever, consuming offers

with chillfactor of 1, it's possible to spawn more than 1 instance per slave
  should: check not only running, but also pending before launch

json serialization was overriden
  fixed

logging not working on executor

deadlock in offercache due to lock acquisition in a for loop
  fixed
